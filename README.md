**Project: Web Directory Lister**

This is a lightweight web directory application designed for simplicity and ease of use.

* **Data-Driven:** Leverages a database to store website information. 
* **Modular Structure:** Employs small, efficient files to fetch data from the database.
* **Centralized Listing:**  A single file acts as the central hub, displaying a list of web pages along with a search function.
* **Minimalistic Design:**  Focuses on functionality without the use of CSS for a clean and unstyled interface.

This project demonstrates the core functionality of a web directory application while prioritizing efficiency and maintainability.

# How to set
Set your database in the db.php file.

In the index file, you have to set the pages you wanna show in the number of lists on a single page. And then the database table and columns.

The rest of the data can be managed by adding more tables or columns.
